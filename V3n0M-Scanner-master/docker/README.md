## Install from Docker Hub
Pull it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vittring/venom):
```bash
docker pull vittring/venom:devel
```
or build bleeding edge from here:
```bash
docker build -t vittring/venom:devel .
docker run --rm -ti vittring/venom:devel
```

## Docker Content Trust is enforced
I do not at present have a way to automate the process of signing the image, then
also signing with my GPG key, but maybe in the future. Content trust is disabled by
default in the Docker Client. To enable it, set the DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST environment
variable to 1. This prevents users from working with tagged images unless they contain
a signature.

When DCT is enabled in the Docker client, docker CLI commands that operate on tagged
images must either have content signatures or explicit content hashes. The commands
that operate with DCT are [available here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/).

Check the integrity of the container by running:
'''bash
docker trust inspect --pretty docker.io/vittring/venom:devel
'''

That's it!
